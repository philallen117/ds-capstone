His route was planned by his friend Scott Partridge, an accountant from Rancho Santa Margarita. The two have been planning the walk for the better part of a year. Partridge plans to help lead Shaw on a route out of Orange County parallel to Ortega Highway that will take them off-road and over craggy terrain. The original plan was to take Ortega, but Partridge said walking and parking vehicles on the highway could cause problems.

About the Cavaliers: The Cavaliers, one of just three teams who already have been eliminated from the playoffs, have won just six games since Nov. 27 and own the NBA's worst record. ...

The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."
No. 24? O.K., it was the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, Texas, area. Succeeded only by Trenton, N.J. But another nearby college area that we can sort of call our own, Bloomington-Normal, Ill., home to Illinois State University, has been ranked No. 15.

"You can see the connection here. Every time that something happens they shove it in a letter," Arpaio said.

But the rule can -- and should -- be your law in your car. Ask back-seat passengers to lock in those seat belts before starting a trip. Far too few of us do that. The LeaseTrader survey indicated only 2 percent of drivers routinely make the safety request over their shoulder. Less than 8 percent ask even half of the time.

"Fortunately, while I write about the struggle, I wake up in the morning most of the time with a smile on my face, and I've managed to make it to the other side of these things. But I know if I just stay true to the experience, and to what I see as real, it's not gonna leave 'em in a dark place -- it just exposes a dark place. I guess what I'm saying is that it's OK to talk about it. I also think if I explain how hard is has been for me, people don't feel so alone. I know that's my reaction when I listen to sad, hard songs -- 'Oh God, they went through that, too. I'm not so alone.'"

There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.

And we know what would happen if Republicans in Congress were allowed to keep holding Richard's nomination hostage. More of our loved ones would be tricked into making bad financial decisions. More dishonest lenders could take advantage of some of the most vulnerable families. And the vast majority of financial firms who do the right thing would be undercut by those who don't.
Obama on Wednesday became the first president in history to support gay marriage, and Romney was careful to use empathic language as he responded to that decision.

It has 30 networked aircraft simulators, the most in any non-Defense Department facility, and a high-tech control room. When planes take off, loud jet noises are piped into the building and rooms vibrate. The simulated hangar bays are dimly lit, just like in real life. Bells ring dignitaries aboard and crew members are alerted by an intercom system. When the mission gets under way, the windows are covered with pictures of ocean scenes and the campers sleep in berths and eat in a mess hall.

Curiously, I know a family that got such an experience up close and personal, finding themselves, as Eastern European farmers, sometime around 1947 being forcibly incorporated into the newly created Soviet “Hungarian People’s Republic.” Be aware the Soviet-style “Republic” has no equal to the American version of “Republic,” for in any Soviet “Republic” the political power was held by the Communist rulers over the common citizen, whereas in America under the Constitution today, (and hopefully ongoing) the political power is held by the people, and wielded by them through their elected representatives and senators.

9) Thirty years ago, Haiti imported no rice, one of the staples of the Haitian diet. Today, almost all of the rice consumed in Haiti is imported. Why? Because when Haiti borrowed money from through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it was forced to open its markets to the world. The U.S. then destroyed the Haitian agricultural system by sending heavily subsidized rice and sugar into Haiti. When food riots broke out in Haiti in 2008, after a spike in worldwide rice prices, an article in the New York Times scolded that Haiti, "it's agricultural industry in shambles, needs to better feed itself." No mention was made of the global market forces that helped to destroy that industry. It's a pattern that has been repeated in many countries. To understand it even

The OHSU scientists plan to inject the stem cells into as many as six children, ages 2 to 12, suffering from one of two forms of Batten disease. These genetic diseases, which hit perhaps three of every 100,000 U.S. children, are caused by low levels of enzymes that break down granules of fat and protein. Without the enzyme, the granules build up in the brain and cause ever more damage until death.

Nor should equal justice for everyone be an issue subject to the usual political horse-trading and back-scratching that goes on in Annapolis. This is different from a simple "vote for the road project in my district, and I'll vote for yours" sort of transaction. The gay marriage issue goes to the heart of values that both advocates and opponents consider fundamental, and it shouldn't be an excuse for lawmakers to swap their votes and their principles to advance ancillary causes, no matter how worthy.

Hey, Michael: I also share your doubts about Griffin. His physical talents (throwing, running) are obvious. I don't like his size, however, or his inability to stay in the pocket and let pass routes develop. He is a smart player, however, and all indications are that he can learn the pro game.

Holding on to all of these rustic, but much-beloved, camps does not seem the best use of the Girl Scouts' resources, especially if the camps don't appeal to a majority of the membership. Many scouts -- and, more important, their mothers, who often serve as camp volunteers and chauffeurs -- want camping to be more like home: indoor toilets, electricity and showers, according to the organization's survey. And because so few scouts go camping, the organization has had to spend over $1 million annually to subsidize the seven camps.
Climate change is a nonpartisan, nondenominational, non-nationalistic issue. We can work together on it—Republicans and Democrats, people of all religious faiths, the United States and other countries. Canada's prime minister has said that if the United States introduces this system, Canada will join in. We need to do this wonderful thing and we need to do it now. Waiting can only make the climate crisis worse, more and more rapidly. Acting now can begin to build a benign new world for our children.

The one thing that hasn't changed much is the focus on wine. Many are offered by the half bottle, and during the summer the list includes lots of rose. The chef pairs each menu item with a glass of rose, but many don't seem to work. For example, the Regaleali Rose d'Almerita that came with the slippery pappardelle pasta in garlic-lemon cream ($9.50 starter/$18.50 main course) clashed so terribly that it was undrinkable.

It’s also important to be thinking like a designer instead of a player. A lot of the stuff we get is just people basically campaigning to have their player be more powerful. They don’t think about the long-term about how that’s bad for the game. All of the things they want to work on are for their selfish desires as a player. You also have to be a huge consumer of games. Anyone we’ve interview, we ask them what games are you playing now, what are your favorite games of all time and why? What flaws have you found in them?

Once the servant of industry, banking became our dominant industry. It has ceased to serve us. We serve it. And when it went all but belly up in the panic of 2008, the federal government bailed it out, on the assumption of those authoring the Troubled Assets Relief Program legislation that the banks would use those funds to bail out our larger society. Instead, they took the money and sat on it. Lending to small business in particular has not bounced back.

Introductions are key. Consider your dog's personality when introducing her to a new love interest. Tailor the first meeting to what will make her most comfortable.

Praise your dog when she interacts well with your future spouse and set aside several subsequent meetings before you combine households.

Grass' wartime past is certainly troublesome. Yet it does little to undercut the power of his anti-fascist novels (including the 1959 masterpiece "The Tin Drum"), nor does it imply that there is anything anti-Semitic about his poem. There isn't; it's a polemic about Israeli policies with which Grass disagrees. For Israelis to accuse him of anti-Semitism plays into a common belief that such accusations are a mere excuse to suppress dissent against official policy.

"We were out for my birthday," she said. "We were parked right next to the crosswalk. I was probably the first person to call 9-1-1."
Carol Shea-Porter's victory over Republican Rep. Jeb Bradley is perhaps the greatest upset of this year's elections. A grassroots candidate whose anger over the war in Iraq prompted her run for office, Shea-Porter was considered a long shot from the beginning and struggled to gain support from the Democratic Party, which backed a state lawmaker whom Shea-Porter defeated convincingly in the party's primary.
The Derby telecast is on NBC, the network for which Randolph used to work when he was moonlighting from his role as sports directors at KSDK (Channel 5) - the station that airs the race locally.

Bead refers to the trail of bubbles that rises from the bottom of the glass.
As a candidate for governor, Whitman spent more than $150 million of her own money to blanket the state with advertising for nearly 18 months to get out her political message. But on Thursday, she was clearly reluctant to criticize Brown, whom she lambasted as a failed career politician during the campaign.
It was a terrific new job—more money, more prestige, more interesting work. But it had one big downside: Because most of the team that I manage is based in New York, I had to split my time between New York and my home office just outside of Boston.
The Jaguars were able to maintain that lead and later expanded on it to finish off the Vikings.

In truth, I'm in a windowless Largo warehouse where one of this year's top workplaces — the National Forensic Science Technology Center — provides forensic training scenarios ranging from mock (but realistic) terrorist caves, car bomb investigation scenes and multiroom apartments in need of CSI-like examination.
I have only my brother-in-law, Tim Limbert, to blame, and to thank. It was he, an avid runner and resident of Charleston, who talked me into this nutty adventure. He who corralled and captained our "ultra" team of six, including his friends Betsy Wallace, Kevin Bush and Jeff and Kara Skahill. We dubbed ourselves the Six Pack.
But Barrett contradicted Feliciano’s claim she and Hinds had agreed not to return Feliciano’s fingerprint card to State Police after he told them it would reveal a "problem" from his past.

I'm sympathetic to the competitive strain the trucks can put on restaurants paying rent and facing strict regulations of their own. But the fact is that people like the trucks and want the variety they offer. Eventually the city must recognize the demand.
He can get funding to go to school. And if he wants to climb the Himalayas, he can get an all-expenses-paid trip. But he can't get a small-business loan or grant funding to help him build his business.

It would not be fair to all those previous college students who have worked their way through college or borrowed what they could to finance their college education and didn't get any federal relief. People need to take some responsibility for their actions and not expect the federal government to come to their aid every time something doesn't go their way.

CC Sabathia hadn't pitched as well as he'd hoped to during his first two starts of the season, and after three innings Tuesday night, it didn't look like his third start would be much different.
At Loyal Army on Haight Street, customers who shop the unabashedly geek-friendly graphic T's and hoodies can choose digital receipts and receive loyalty rewards, thanks to Proximiant, a Mountain View startup launched in December that relies on near-field communication, or NFC, technology capable of transmitting data wirelessly to similarly enabled devices close to one another. Just a tap is all it takes to send transaction details from the checkout at Loyal Army to a customer's NFC-enabled smart phone.
The film's enduring value, though, lies in what it has to say -- never didactically, always inferentially -- about the power of art, the strength and fragility of artists (one scene in a cafe, involving Christa and a hitherto secret admirer, is as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking), and what it means to be human.
Armstrong indicated that Perron's improvement took "a big jump" a few months ago. At that point, Perron attempted basic exercises to see how his body would respond.

The grid modernization plan was authorized in a bill approved by the legislature last year. The sweeping measure also established a formula for setting future electric rates in Illinois.
"We believe there are a lot of distressed assets out there beyond Atlantic City," he said. "Atlantic City is the core of the company, but for any one company to put all its eggs in one basket is dangerous."
The film opened in Plano, Texas -- an upscale suburb of Dallas -- and did great business there, too. Falk says for the first week in Jacksonville, Fla., "we did double anything else we did that week.'' Even in Utah, where there was a brief flap when one Salt Lake City exhibitor pulled the movie, "Brokeback'' is doing very well.
But he also wrote that News Corp. would hand over "every piece of evidence we find" of wrongdoing at the tabloid, and other British papers, to the police.

The ceremony ended with Isekenegbe throwing out the first pitch of the Dukes home opener, a hard strike that sailed right over the heart of the plate.
Posey, 23, hit one of his patented backspin shots that just kept carrying until it landed like a lawn dart beyond the center-field fence. Andres Torres and Edgar Renteria each had three hits; it was Renteria's first three-hit output in the World Series since his walkoff single ended Game 7 in 1997. Torres doubled home Renteria in the seventh.
"No one has ever been more conscientious as a teammate," La Russa said.
HOW THEY MET: Nala was rescued from a high kill shelter in North Carolina and brought to Baltimore where we adopted her.
White’s telling of the story varied slightly. He left out that he was playing with Dietrich at one of the nicest hotels in the country.
Workers played blackjack and dice in a section called Little Las Vegas. They brought booze to the job in their lunch pails. The sage whiff of marijuana filtered out of the bathrooms and lingered behind the plant where they dumped scrap metal.
The significant participation of Fidel Castro's Cuba in the African independence movement of the 1960s gets a detailed look in "Cuba: An African Odyssey," while the first female president of Africa's oldest independent republic is profiled in "Iron Ladies of Liberia." Like Burnett's film, "Iron Ladies" was made with the full cooperation of the government it portrays and could be seen as one-sided, but with filmmaking money so scarce, it's hard to fault the filmmakers too much.
State Police in Cranbury said a box truck carrying wood caught fire shortly after 4 p.m. in the southbound truck lanes.
The former landmark sign depicting a smiling, buck-toothed man wearing a gray tuxedo and holding a platter of chicken is shown on a window of the restaurant, the menu and appears as a cardboard cutout in the entryway.

"We're numb," said Chief Deputy Auditor Samir Mohammad. "We're shocked that it happened this way."
Bartolotta, however, is confident. His kicking throughout the summer was accurate and strong. He is convinced a 50-yard field goal is well within his reach - Warriors assistant coach Tim Brengle boomed a 50-yarder to set the Fox record in 2000 - and while waiting for chances to help the offense, Bartolotta will focus on punting (a new duty) and kickoffs.
"He's gone out of his way to let guys in this room know he appreciates what we have to say," says pitcher Jake Westbrook, who is entering his 17th professional season. "There's a respect factor that runs both ways. That became clear pretty quickly."
"He can do some things to keep plays alive, but it comes down to finishing them," said Fickell.
Walter dismissed Von Saher's claim after finding that the Netherlands had complied with its obligations under external restitution. He ruled that allowing the "Adam and Eve" case to go forward would improperly circumvent the sole authority over foreign policy that the constitution grants to the federal government.
This grew only more heightened once the first part of "Maus" came out and Spiegelman had to complete the work. "Maus I" ends at the gates of Auschwitz — its own kind of dead end, since, he explains, "it was impossible for me to imagine life in the death camps." Besides his father's memories, there were few useful sources; one was Tadeusz Borowski's "This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen," a 1959 story collection Spiegelman admired for its "chilled, camera-like eye, as if Raymond Chandler was not the sentimentalist he is but had been in Auschwitz."
Peters brought with her a memoir she had written in 1963 about her life in Russia. "Twenty Letters to a Friend" was published within months of her arrival in the United States and became a best-seller.
It later became shockingly clear what they were doing and what it had cost their victims. "While they were doing all this extravagant stuff they were wiping out people making $30,000, $40,000 a year," said Waters, who heard stories of the two walking around town in fur coats.
Lyons, who had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath, was also found to be in possession of a second bag of heroin, he said.
Sadly, I'm sure there will be new projects that will demand tax subsidies, and almost surely, they will get them.
Plus, if you're at Yankee Stadium, Citi Field or a tailgate, use our new apps to submit photos from the game, which will then appear on NJ.com.
It would be premature to believe that Oetken's easy confirmation heralds some new post-sexual era in American politics; the fight over gay marriage continues undiminished. But it was a signal moment nonetheless. The nominee's sexual orientation was deemed unimportant -- or at least less important than his moderate politics and his pro-business record (he's a corporate lawyer, with Cablevision).
And I think we can all agree that Guillen did not represent the Marlins well here.
Suggs, 29, had a career-best 14 sacks last season and has 82.5 in his career. He was a first-round pick by the Ravens in 2003. Suggs was named the Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year in 2011.
Barbara Ostrom of Lincoln has a special place for her well-traveled rosewood rocker. Inlaid with mother of pearl, the carved rocker  likely made in the mid-1800s  was a wedding gift to her grandmother in 1899 in Toronto. It traveled from Canada to Riverside to Oakland, and now Lincoln.

I was more interested in the baseball bat. "You always keep a baseball bat in case things get busy," Ms. Klein stated delicately. She knows her subject, and her peace-making equipment, having worked 14 years as a bartender, waitress and restaurant union organizer in New York and New Jersey, before turning to bar-themed literature. Her current book project involves New Jersey bar bands of the 1970s.

"The rookies are obviously behind from a mental and a physical standpoint," Raiders coach Dennis Allen said. "They're going to have to work hard and work fast to get caught up because if they don't get caught up pretty soon, they'll fall behind. It's real important to have this camp for them."
Bunz said if he had a son, he'd probably advise him to not play football.
He begins with a letter dated 1915 from a man named Camille asking for a girl named Louise's hand in marriage. There are two photos of the same man taken 50 years apart, a postcard from a father to his daughter from the front lines of World War I, a rosary, a tiny calendar-diary and two calling cards. With these clues, Stratton, who has become ill with fever and taken to bed, uses all his skills as a translator and researcher to put flesh on the bones of the story. As he unpacks the box, more clues emerge.
"But above that, it’s important to remember that dry weather makes for some of the greatest quality fruits," Alstede said. "That’s when the sugar density is at its highest. So I think some of the peaches and tomatoes are going to have the some of the best flavor we’ve ever had."
An OHS investigator visited the property based on a citizen's concern that residents might be operating a breeding business. Instead, Wendy Reimer found cat owners "very grateful for the help OHS offered."
So serious is the orchestra's position, in fact, that Music Director Franz Welser-Most and Executive Director Gary Hanson volunteered to take pay cuts of 20 percent and 15 percent, respectively, reductions amounting to more than $300,000. Other senior management will accept cuts of 10 percent, Hanson said Tuesday.

McGraugh said she's unaware of any Missouri court that has allowed experts to challenge the reliability of witness identifications.
I'd like to say I have the kind of juice to demand an apology from David Letterman and make him issue one. But the truth is, pressure came at him from all sides (including, allegedly, his mother) to apologize for last week's joke about one of Sarah Palin's daughters getting "knocked up" during the seventh inning of a Yankee game.

Perhaps it’s because Rolle has lost in a Super Bowl before (with the Arizona Cardinals, in Super Bowl XLIII). He’s gone through this process and come home empty-handed. He was careful not to downplay any member of the Patriots today, including the matchup nightmares of tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez.
“But that was just like a kid in a candy shop, seeing what I can get,” Wheating said. “But this year, I’m full-on excited. It’s my last year as a Duck. I’m a senior. I’m graduating. You’ve got the home crowd advantage. Everything is kind of flowing Oregon’s way.”
That's why even if Senator Currie is found innocent he should be removed from office. With all the additional taxes and toll increases being heaped on Maryland taxpayers, we simply can't afford that kind of stupidity in our elected officials — or the cost of paying a public defender to represent them in court after they've been accused committing some stupid act.

At the Biden group's last meeting Wednesday, discussions over whether to include taxes were particularly contentious, Mr. Cantor said. This was unlike most meetings over the past seven weeks, in which Mr. Biden kept the talks focused on areas of possible agreement on spending cuts, while sidestepping the tax issue.
"It's one of the worst days in the history of Camden," said Ken Chambers, the president of the firefighters union.
As logging industrialized, poor men became rich, and a rich landscape became poor. After arriving in America in 1852 as an 18-year-old German immigrant, Frederick Weyerhaeuser later controlled a logging empire valued at $70 million. Apart from canny purchasing of timberlands around the Great Lakes, his masterstroke was forming a syndicate of formerly rival lumber companies. By breaking logjams of wood being floated down the Mississippi, everyone's production improved; at the same time, cut land around the Great Lakes became a tinderbox. In 1871, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire seared 2,000 square miles and claimed more than a thousand lives. In the Badger State alone, more fires followed in 1891, 1894, 1897, 1908, 1910, 1923, 1931 and 1936. "Losing half a million acres in a year was almost commonplace," Rutkow observes.
"The bad news in a crisis," Ghosn explained, "is that you're in trouble and if you don't fix it, you're part of history. But if you do fix it, you're putting this in your DNA, and you're preparing yourself to face other crises."

Bart Graves of the Arizona Department of Public Safety said the patrol officer was traveling west on Loop 101 around 1:45 a.m. when he saw headlights coming toward him.

“Look, any conductor who plays with these guys, it’s going to be good. People will be appreciative and respectful.

That’s what people are excited about.”
Related tensions could also begin to affect policing in Surprise, said Ted Hunt, a police consultant who spent more than 30 years as a Los Angeles officer.
A. Possibly. If banks are forced to hold a higher percentage of capital for all the loans they write, it will prevent the kind of zero-down, zero-interest loans that were offered during the real estate boom. And if banks are stronger, they will be able to withstand the kind of losses that they faced during the last financial crisis.

Which is not to say that a vacation to Hawaii can be done on a dime. We pounced on a $550 round-trip airfare, but even that meant $2,200 for a family of four. Because it was our first visit, we hopscotched among three islands – the Big Island, Oahu and Kauai – which meant $60-per-person flights from one island to the next. My husband covered six nights' lodging for free by saving hotel credit card points for more than a year, but the one hotel night we paid for ran $350. We also paid for rental cars, but that let us skip taxis and tour buses.

"At the current New Jersey minimum wage, a full-time employee earns only $15,080. In comparison, the federal poverty level for a two-person household is $15,130. If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey," DeAngelo wrote in a letter to the editor published in The Times of Trenton on Feb. 27.
A fitting tribute would be a statue outside Chase Field, where Colangelo delivered the Valley's first major professional sports championship.

The consensus (both in London and New York) has been that this approach makes a well-known show less predictable and more poignant. The New York Times' Ben Brantley found the new version's "deliberately disheveled" treatment "warm, winning, inspired... delivers the unexpected lesson that in theater, shabby can be not only chic but redemptive."

The lack of consensus among Messrs. O'Malley, Miller and Busch after this morning's meeting, the trio's first face-to-face-to-face since the morning after the session adjourned in chaos, is neither surprising nor particularly dispiriting. It will take time for the ill will and recriminations that followed the session to fade, and the two legislative leaders will need to feel out their caucuses to see where they stand. After taking a beating in their districts, senators and delegates may be much more eager to come together than they were two weeks ago. The public is angry that the governor and legislators didn't do their jobs during the 90-day regular session, and the only way to calm them is to come back in a special session and do the people's business quickly and efficiently. Today's meeting didn't end in a deal, but it at least suggested a path forward.

"There really is no evidence of that, in any athlete, that wear and tear, like gradual wearing away of the ACL, is an issue in terms of the injury," Altchek said.
It turns out that there is no unanimity of scientists supporting man-made global warming theory and never has been. It's also now becoming widely recognized that there is no incontrovertible evidence that global warming is caused by human activity, and that there is quite a bit of evidence that human activity is not a primary cause of such warming.
This president has come as close as any in history to advocating marriage equality.

While the old sandwich, ice cream, taco and even barbecue trucks have been around for years, the new generation of food truck wheels around an elevated or novel cuisine.

Tour guide Ann Lombardi of the Trip Chicks recently watched a schemer in the Frankfurt, Germany, train station perform the classic "hollow suitcase with rollers and frame trick," which Lombardi says works thusly: "A distracted tourist takes his eyes off his bag for just a second.

In a flash, the thief lifts the enormous hollow luggage, puts it over the tourist's bag, and calmly wheels away the Trojan Horse with his prized catch inside."

But what if the Americans who hold these beliefs are not, in fact, clear-eyed observers of the world scene stripped of its anti-imperial mystifications? Instead, what if they are people who have fallen for the same self-delusion that the British ruling class entertained before World War I, which was that their empire was so essential to world stability and, at least when compared with the alternatives and with empires past, so just that its hegemony could and would weather all challenges?

“It really allows you to focus on yourself, not so much prep work for the other team,” the Glen Burnie native and Old Mill graduate said. “We had two stretches where we went through three games in seven or eight days, and we really just focused on ourselves and executed and sharpened some things up and then not as much personnel work for the other team. We really focused on ourselves. So I think that plays to our strengths at times because we know how good we can be and if we just perfect the things we need to do, I think we can beat anybody we need to.

They decided to focus on reliability and driving practice, even calling upon fellow NorCal teams to spar with them and focus on nothing but trying to thwart Archie, renamed after their robot's new Archimedes screw drive, from scoring.

Despite the unapologetic nature of the GT-R, it's hard to argue with the sheer value the car presents. Plenty of ink has been spent debating the merits of this car versus the aforementioned Corvette and Porsche. $100,000 can buy you a version of one of the three that will undoubtedly put a smile on your face. The difference lies in the widely varied way each car draws out said smile. Where the GT-R trumps the others is how it is the only one of the three that has nearly all of the capabilities and physicality of a high-end supercar. For better or worse.

Four more years of a radical leftist in the White House would be unacceptable.

But next time you look in the mirror and see that distinctive "protuberance of flesh above the waistband of a tight pair of trousers," (to quote the OED) you should try saying "muffin top" with a little love, says Jean Fain, author of "The Self-Compassion Diet", and a practicing psychotherapist who teaches at Harvard Medical School.

For Democrats, keeping their majority intact is crucial.

The presence of three to eight fetuses, of course, does not have to result in the birth of three to seven children. Thanks to a procedure called multifetal reduction, parents have the ability to reduce the number of fetuses and therefore limit the risks to the mother and the remaining babies. It is obviously a difficult and painful decision for prospective parents, but the bottom line is that multifetal reduction can vastly reduce the chances of an extremely premature birth and other complications.

I remember very little about the fainting experience. Again this experience might teach one to expect the unexpected.
Size matters. You'll need to know the height and width of the space the bookcase will go into, making allowances for locations near radiators, heating vents, doors and windows, and under wall lighting.

The measure would take away the government's authority to liquidate "too big to fail" financial institutions to avoid a Wall Street crisis, claiming $22.5 billion in paper savings that most budget experts say are illusory.
